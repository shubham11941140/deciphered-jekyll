*loauth* is a lightweight extensible library designed to provide ease of implementations using challenge-response communication protocols.
Written in python, we are actively looking at developers to port it for various hardware platforms. Below is a test snippet for the Base Class of the loauth authentication library. 
```

import hashlib
import hmac as hm
import Cijfer
class test(Cijfer.cijfer):
    def sign(self, key, msg):
        return hm.new(key, msg, hashlib.sha256).digest()

    def verify(self, key, msg, sign):
        return hm.compare_digest(sign, hm.new(key, msg, hashlib.sha256).digest() )

```
