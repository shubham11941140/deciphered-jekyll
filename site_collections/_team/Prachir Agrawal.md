### About me 
I am BTech student in IIT Bhilai. I am pursuing Computer Science and Engineering, and joined the institute in 2019. I have a keen interest on finding how many websites leave a lot of vulnerable data of users. I want to explore more in the field of Web Security.

I love to keep myself updated with latest happenings of the tech world, and enjoy learning more about the same.
